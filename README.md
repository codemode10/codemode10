ðŸ”­ After completing a coding bootcamp at Le Wagon in April 2023, I've been honing my skills as a Freelance web developer.

ðŸŒ± I recently wrapped up a project where I conceptualised, designed, and implemented an interactive, mobile-friendly web application. It's built with Ruby on Rails and uses the Mapbox API. The site serves as a dynamic platform for users to explore various activities in Paris through an interactive map, and also features a robust, user-friendly commenting system.

- I have a keen interest in front-end design, with a special focus on creating captivating JavaScript animations.

Hi there I'm Lloyd ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Since finishing a coding bootcamp at Le Wagon in April 2023, I have been working as a Freelance web developer to further my learning. 

- ðŸŒ± I recently completed a project where I conceptualised, designed, and implemented an interactive mobile-friendly web application using Ruby on Rails and Mapbox API. The website is a dynamic platform for users to discover various activities in Paris through an interactive map and also allows them to engage in rich conversations through a user-friendly commenting system. Have a look at https://www.middaymidnightinparis.site/
